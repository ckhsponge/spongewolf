Quick start example

Getting a rails app set up to use Sponger for event management is easy! Below are some steps for creating a rails app that displays a web page with a list of events from the site http://remindblast.com.

1. Create the rails app
Make sure you have rails 2.0 or later installed. If you're not sure then run:
gem install rails
To generate your rails app, run the following command:
rails sponger_test

2. Generate a controller for your app
Change directory into sponger_test and run:
ruby script/generate controller sponger

3. Add a method to your controller
Edit the file app/controller/sponger_controller.rb and the following method:
  #gets all events from 2008-04-15 that were created from remindblast.com
  def events
    @events = Sponger::Event.find(:all,:params=>{:calendar_id=>137619,:start_time=>Date.new(2008,04,15)})
  end

4. Add a view
Create the file app/views/sponger/events.rhtml and paste the following into it:
<% for event in @events -%>
  <%= h event.title %>
  <br>
<% end -%>

5. Start your server
ruby script/server start

6. Check the results
Point your browser at http://localhost:3000/sponger/events
You should see a list of events that were created as reminders. Done!
